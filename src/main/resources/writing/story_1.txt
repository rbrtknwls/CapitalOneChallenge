Thump, Thump, Thump.

The noise reverberates all over the cramped dark bedroom, its only getting louder and louder.

Roland lies on his back, staring at the blank expression of his blank white ceiling, allowing the noise to wash over him.

Thump, Thump, Thump. "OPEN UP.... I MISS YOU... OPEN THE DOOR"

Roland crushed the pillow into his chest, when was the last time he could sleep soundly? The voice and thumping were ingrained in his mind, following him into his short sleeps and restless days.

“Please just go” Roland said softly, he eagerly watched the light under his door.

He couldn’t remember how long it had been since he boarded his windows and broke his lights, now his only source of light came from the door that was begging to be opened.

“Roland… I’m worried about you” The door said softly, it was the voice of his mother. The door would play this trick often: mimicking the voices of his loved ones that it caught.

“Roland… please open this door, I miss you” the voice was firm, it was meant to be his father.

Roland let out a scoff, not once had his father ever expressed himself like this, it seems that while the voice could be mimicked the content couldn’t. Roland forced himself up to his feet and stumbled his way to the door and pressed his ear to the cold wood. He heard faint slithering.

Roland knew these voices were fake, if he was able to focus enough he could hear the real voices through the deception. “Focus” he told himself as he concentrated all his energy on deciphering the annunciation of the door.

There was the voice again, he slid down the door frame until he felt his butt prick something on the floor. His hand reached down and he could feel his hot blood stick to his fingers.

Bits of his standing mirror stabbed into him, the result of a smashing it countless nights back. The mirror was a curse to him ever since he was locked in the room, he would watch everyday as his face would degrade more and more.

His eyes where the first to go, he would watch as they would sink deeper and deeper into his face. Charcoal black shadows would appear under them, contrasting with his pale skin. Eventually the face in the mirror no longer seemed to belong to him, it was the shape of a hideous monster similar to those at the door.

This monster haunted Roland until he couldnt take it anymore, he smashed his fist into the mirror causing it to scatter into a million pieces. Markings still covered his hand from where the jaded glass had cut it open.

He felt the pool of blood spread under his weight covering his backside and reaching the door. He watched as the shadows under the door shifted rapidly when they caught the scent of his blood

"OPEN!!! OPEN!!!!" thump, thump, Thump, THUMP, THUMP, THUMP

The monsters had gotten more frantic, the doors vibrations startled him as they got more and more intense. He pressed his back firmly into the wooden door to try and cushion the blows, his hands gripped into the ridges in the wall to support him.

He used to keep track of the days that passed by scraping markings into the wall, a line for each day that would pass. At first it was a relief to him, Roland figured that the most he would be trapped in this room would be 20 days and after that someone would have dealt with the monsters. However as day after day passed and nothing changed.

After the 100th day, the markings became a curse. They reminded him how long he had been alone and that help would never come, he hated these markings. Every day and night they would be staring at him, taunting him that no one would come to his rescue.

Scratching the markets had no effect, he could still make out their form. Roland would rather live in darkness then be presented with the reality of his situation, he ripped out the lights and boarded the windows so that his room was filled with total darkness.

Roland was too weak, he knew this. He knew that the monsters outside his door were real, he knew that they had already killed all his loved ones. He was the only one left, and the one that had to hold on.

But as the blood spilled from his failing body he knew that he was weak, he knew that he couldnt last much longer.

His hand reached for the door knob, his fingers gently reset on the lock.

"Mother what school do I go to?" he said softly

The voice didnt even try to echo his mother and yet he didnt care. It would be better to be dead then to be alone like this.

He pulled open the lock with the last of his strength, the door was pushed open and the light flowed in.

Thanks for reading! I think this is the first time I have written a whole story, I apologize if it was a little tough to read I dont really know how to write very vividly but I hope you liked the idea.

I think the idea of being trapped and confined to the same place for a long period of time is super scary, and I think if I did a better job conveying the diration that Roland was trapped it would have made the story alot spookier. But what do you think?

and dw dw I will def improve for the next story.
